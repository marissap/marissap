# Hi 👋
I'm Marissa—a software engineer intern at Twitch working on Video Distribution to build and maintain the infrastructure that supports a diverse community of streamers and viewers. I'm also in the process of getting a CS degree from the University of Ottawa. I like tech because it's dope. I like to build tech because it has the power to create social good. 🌿

## A collection of my favourite things
🛣  Long drives at sunset<br>
🌌  Looking up at the night sky<br>
🎶  Listening to live music with friends<br>
🧠  Breaking down a problem into hand-written diagrams<br>
🎨  Looking at art so stunning you can't help but stare silently<br>
