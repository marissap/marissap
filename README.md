I'm Marissa—a software engineer at Twitch working on Video Distribution to build and maintain the infrastructure that supports a diverse community of streamers and viewers. I also have a CS degree. I like tech. 🌿

## A collection of my favourite things
🛣  Long drives at sunset<br>
🌌  Looking up at the night sky<br>
🎶  Listening to live music with friends<br>
🧠  Breaking down a problem into hand-written diagrams<br>
